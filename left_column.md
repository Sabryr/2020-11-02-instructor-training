### Workshop for present and future instructors

This is a workshop for future instructors of courses for users
of high-performance computing resources.

The focus of this workshop is on:
- the teaching part, not the HPC part (but we will discuss this in an HPC context)
- lesson design
- preparing and organizing online workshops

---

### Homework before the course

- Read this short paper 
  [The Science of Learning](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/files/papers/science-of-learning-2015.pdf) 
  which provides a brief overview of some key evidence-based results in teaching.  
  This paper is also used by [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) for their Instructor Training workshops.

- Watch at least two of the recorded
  ["this is my training philosophy" videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpLblYHCzJAAHF89P-GCjEXWC8CF-7nhX)
  (they are short!)
  which we will
  discuss in group discussions and which will form the basis for a group
  exercise.

### Monday, Nov 9, 12:50 - 17:00 CET

In this half day event, we will take learners on a tour around HPCCarpentry,
discuss its motivation and short history. We will focus on taking a deep dive
at lesson development. We will cover best practices for designing lessons, for
designing exercises and adjoint learning objectives to structure the process of
community driven open educational resources as we understand them. The course
will conclude by discussing how application specific teaching materials can be
set up and which pitfalls to avoid in this domain. The course will provide room
for self-experimentation based on HPCCarpentry material and teaching modules
around LAMMPS. If time permits, contributions to open-source material are
encouraged.

- HPC Carpentry lesson [Introduction to High-Performance Computing](https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/hpc-intro/)
- FocusCoE/E-CAM lesson on [Running LAMMPS on HPC systems](https://fzj-jsc.github.io/tuning_lammps/)

**To prepare for the event**, we would love if participants could bring along
statistics on how their HPC site is used. For example, it would be lovely if
learners could bring a histogram of (successful) job runtimes and other such
summary statistics from your site. Besides that, a stable internet connection,
your will to communicate and clear audio quality is all that is needed.
