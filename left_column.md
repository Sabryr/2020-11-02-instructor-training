### Workshop for present and future instructors

Do you (want to) teach researchers or independent students best practices of
scientific software?  Are you teaching a university course and would like to
include aspects of best practices in software engineering in the course?  Or
would you simply like to educate your friends and colleagues in how to write
more reusable, reproducible and better documented code? Please join us!

### Schedule

#### Prerequisites: homework before the course

Before the training:

- Complete our pre-workshop survey. Your responses will help us to customize the workshop appropriately.

- Read this short paper [The Science of Learning](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/files/papers/science-of-learning-2015.pdf) which provides a brief overview of some key evidence-based results in teaching. This paper is also used by [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) for their Instructor Training workshops.

- Watch at least two of recorded ca. 5-minute
  [lightning overview videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpLblYHCzJABvt25VY0wNIgbaQfTQaND7)
  introducing various
  [CodeRefinery lessons](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/)
  to get an overview of what we teach in CodeRefinery and also to be
  able to practice CodeRefinery teaching on day 2 of this course.

- Watch at least two of recorded
  ["this is my training philosophy" videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpLblYHCzJAAHF89P-GCjEXWC8CF-7nhX)
