### Workshop for present and future instructors

This is a workshop for future instructors of courses for users
of high-performance computing resources.

The focus of this workshop is on:
- the teaching part, not the HPC part (but we will discuss this in an HPC context)
- lesson design
- preparing and organizing online workshops

---

### Homework before the course

- Read this short paper 
  [The Science of Learning](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/files/papers/science-of-learning-2015.pdf) 
  which provides a brief overview of some key evidence-based results in teaching.  
  This paper is also used by [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) for their Instructor Training workshops.

- Watch at least two of the recorded
  ["this is my training philosophy" videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpLblYHCzJAAHF89P-GCjEXWC8CF-7nhX)
  (they are short!)
  which we will
  discuss in group discussions and which will form the basis for a group
  exercise.
